2 Perf Goals:

    1. Visit fewer nodes:
    2. More efficient processing at each node

Visit fewer nodes:
    caching (structural hashing)
    more reasoning at each step

More efficient processing at each node
    Add some "just once" processing
        For example:
            1. best xors
            2. Var scores
            3. isLitImp
        Cache in file:
            PL:
                vars:
                constraints:
                cached-computed:

Next step:
Improve vars section:
    vars
    bool:
