Diff: reqs needed by current Toyota UI and our API

Note: See inventoryrules.json for some hints


Out of inventory colors (or Out of inventory anything)
Toyota is start with "init defaults"
    defaulted user pics, computed once at session init
    thereafter, these are treated as user pics

    After session init every dontCare is set to either true or false. There are no opens.
        this negates half our api:
        this negates csp.getBB();

    An invalid pic (i.e. implied false) is:
        sometimes *hidden*
        sometimes shown with special "invalid pic" ui treatment (which, when clicked, triggers a fix list popup)
        Pic Ones: sometimes shown like anyother pic (no fix list) which must mean, if they pick it, it's doing some type fixlist (and the subsequent fix) auto-magically.

    distinguishing between "invalid pic due to factory rules" vs "invalid pic due to out of stock"
        formula current Hitachi impl, this is kind of a fudge:
            series/year/region wide "out of stock features" are simply:
                series/year/region wide "dead features"

        out of inventory color means:
            series/year factory dead features minus series/year/region inventory "dead features"
            where:
                series/year factory "dead features" is generated from old csp (FM)
                series/year/region inventory "dead features" is generated from dnnf csp

        invalid (bang) color means: "dead features" based on current picks
